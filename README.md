# 🎮 👨‍💻 João Pedro C. A. de Sá

** `AI Enthusiast` **

I have a degree in computer engineering and currently my focus is studying data science and AI.
I believe that through research we can grow and be relevant within the IT area, that's why I'm studying to get a master's degree at a good institution.
My free time is spent playing video games and reading fiction books!
